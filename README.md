# Read Alerts from the HOP server

If you want to try to simulate a complete SNEWS chain, you will need to install the snews_pt and snews_cs repositories from git and you will need to install hop using pip install -U hop-client and have hop credentials. You can also test the chain locally, but this will require you some fixes.
